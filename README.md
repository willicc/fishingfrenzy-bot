# üé£ Fishing Frenzy Automation Toolkit | Thanks To Bingo Crypto ü§ñ

This is an automation toolkit designed specifically for the Fishing Frenzy web game, containing two core scripts:

* **Bulk Invite**: Automatically generates wallets and binds referral codes to produce `tokens` for subsequent operations.
* **Fully Automated Fishing**: Uses the generated `tokens` to automatically complete daily tasks and the core fishing operations.

## üë• Module 1: Bulk Invite Registration Script (`auto_reff.py`)

This script is designed for users who need to create many new accounts and bind specific referral codes, automating the entire process from wallet generation to logging into the game and verifying the referral code. **It is recommended to run this script first to generate the `tokens.txt` required by the next module.**

### ‚ú® Core Features

* **Bulk wallet generation**: Automatically generate a specified number of Ethereum wallets and save the information to `walletX.json`.
* **SIWE automatic authentication**: Automatically complete authentication for new wallets using the SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) protocol.
* **Automatic game login**: Use the authentication tokens to obtain the game `access-token` and save them to `tokens.txt`, which can be used directly for Module 2.
* **Bind referral codes**: Bind the specified referral code to all new accounts.
* **Proxies & concurrency**: Support reading proxies from `proxies.txt` and rotating them, using multithreaded concurrent processing.
* **Retry on failure**: Built-in retry mechanism to handle network fluctuations.

### üîß Installation & Configuration

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BingoCrypto/fishingfrenzy-bot
cd fishingfrenzy-bot
```

**2. Install dependencies**

This script has separate dependencies, run in terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configuration files**

* **`tokens.txt`**: One game account `access-token` per line. You can use the `tokens.txt` generated by Module 1 or add tokens manually.
* **`proxies.txt`**: One proxy per line, supporting formats `http://user:password@ip:port` or `ip:port`.

- `Recommended proxy`:   [Nstproxy](https://app.nstproxy.com/register?i=O5qx52) global rotating proxy with traffic as low as \$0.8/G.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Script (Module 1)

1. Run in project terminal:

   ```bash
   python auto_reff.py
   ```
2. The program will prompt you to enter your referral code.
3. Then it will prompt for the number of wallets to generate.
4. After input, the script will automatically complete all subsequent operations.

## ü§ñ Module 2: Fully Automated Smart Fishing Bot (`main.py`)

This script can simulate real player behavior, running unattended 24/7 across multiple game accounts, automatically completing daily tasks, sign-ins, claiming rewards, and executing core fishing operations to maximize efficiency and yield.

### ‚ú® Core Features

* **Multi-account management**: Supports `tokens.txt` generated by the auto-invite, or manually configured tokens for any number of game accounts to perform bulk operations.
* **Smart proxy rotation**: Automatically reads proxies from `proxies.txt` and rotates them per request for each account to prevent IP-based operation failures.
* **Fully automated daily tasks**: Automatically completes newbie tutorial, daily sign-in, and social task rewards.
* **Intelligent decision engine**: Automatically purchases items when coins are sufficient and uses recovery items when energy is low.
* **Advanced fishing simulation**: Uses asynchronous WebSocket interactions with the game server, with built-in AI simulating the dynamic process of net chasing fish to pass server verification.
* **High-performance concurrency**: Built on Python `asyncio` to achieve true asynchronous concurrency and efficiently handle multiple accounts simultaneously.
* **Robust fault tolerance**: Built-in retry mechanism (default 3 attempts) to handle network fluctuations or temporary errors.
* **Detailed logging**: Colorful logs provide real-time feedback on each account‚Äôs execution status.

### üîß Installation & Configuration

* Module one is universal; no extra installation configuration needed.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Bot (Module 2)

1. Complete installation and configuration.
2. Run in project terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Select fishing type (`1`, `2`, or `3`) and press Enter.
4. The bot will start running. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

* **Core framework**: Python 3 + `asyncio`
* **HTTP requests**: `aiohttp` & `aiohttp-proxy`
* **WebSocket communication**: `aiohttp`
* **Log beautification**: `colorama`
* **Ethereum interaction**: `eth-account`, `siwe`
